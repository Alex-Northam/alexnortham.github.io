        Interests:<br>
        I am very involved in Scouting and have been a part of the organisation since I joined Beavers at the age of<br>
        6. I stayed in Scouting for 10 years in total until I left my Explorer Group earlier this year.<br>
        <br>
        I was a volunteer at a Beaver group for just over a year and since January 2019 I have been a Young Leader<br>
        there and have completed the Young Leader training course in this time. A Young Leader takes responsibility<br>
        for helping to plan and deliver meetings with the group leaders. The modules instruct you on different parts<br>
        of being a leader, such as how to plan meetings and first aid, meaning that when you have completed them all<br>
        you have all the necessary skills to organise meetings, deliver them safely, make them accessible, and take<br>
        feedback to improve next time around.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoyed completing the Duke Of Edinburgh Award at both Bronze and Silver level. This involved completing a<br>
        volunteering activity, physical activity and a skill for a set amount of months each and then completing a<br>
        practice expedition and a qualifying expedition. At Bronze level I did 6 months volunteering at the Beaver<br>
        Group, 3 months doing physical work at the gym and 3 months doing cooking as a skill. Both expeditions were<br>
        2 days and 1 night and were located in Surrey. For my Silver I did 6 months volunteering at an after school<br>
        club, 3 months doing physical work at the gym and 3 months taking Young Leaders modules as a skill. Both<br>
        expeditions were 3 days and 2 nights and took place in the Peak District.<br>

        I am very interested in computers and I find it interesting to learn about them. I have recently built a PC<br>
        out of the different components, and I have experience working with computers and I consider myself to be<br>
        very computer literate.<br>
